            <h3> <b>Who we are</b></h3>


            Our website address is: WEB LINK.
            <br>

            <br>
            <h3>What personal data we collect and why we collect it</h3>


            <h4><b>Comments</b></h4>

            When visitors leave comments on the site we collect the data shown in the comments form, and also the
            visitor's IP
            address and browser user agent string to help spam detection. <br>



            <br>
            An anonymized string created from your email address (also called a hash) may be provided to the
            Gravatar service to see
            if you are using it. The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here:
            MY LINK. After approval of your comment, your profile picture is visible to the public in the context of
            your comment.<br>


            <h4><b>Media</b></h4>

            If you upload images to the website, you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF
            GPS) included.
            Visitors to the website can download and extract any location data from images on the website.<br>

            <br>

            <h4><b>Contact forms</b></h4>
            <h4><b>Cookies</b></h4>
            If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address and website in
            cookies. These are
            for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another
            comment. These cookies
            will last for one year. <br>

            <br>
            If you visit our login page, we will set a temporary cookie to determine if your browser accepts
            cookies.
            This cookie contains no personal data and is discarded when you close your browser. <br>

            <br>
            When you log in, we will also set up several cookies to save your login information and your screen
            display choices.
            Login cookies last for two days, and screen options cookies last for a year. If you select "Remember
            Me", your login
            will persist for two weeks. If you log of your account, the login cookies will be removed. <br>

            <br>
            If you edit or publish an article, an additional cookie will be saved in your browser. This cookie
            includes no personal
            data and simply indicates the post ID of the article you just edited. It expires after 1 day. <br>

            <br>



            <h4><b>Embedded content from other websites</b></h4>


            Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded
            content from other
            websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website. <br>

            <br>
            These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and
            monitor your
            interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if
            you have an
            account and are logged in to that website.

            <h3><b>Who we share your data with</b></h3>


            <h3><b>How long we retain your data</b></h3>


            If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can
            recognize and approve
            any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue. <br>

            <br>
            For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in
            their user
            profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot
            change their
            username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information. <br>

            <br>
            <h3><b>What rights you have over your data</b></h3>


            If you have an account on this site, or have left comments, you can request to receive an exported file
            of the personal
            data we hold about you, including any data you have provided to us. You can also request that we erase
            any personal data
            we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or
            security
            purposes. <br>

            <br>
            <h3><b>Where we send your data</b></h3>


            Visitor comments may be checked through an automated spam detection service. <br>


            <h3><b>Your contact information</b></h3>


            <h3><b>Additional information</b></h3>

            <h3><b>How we protect your data</b></h3>


            <h3><b>What data breach procedures we have in place</b></h3>


            <h3><b>What third parties we receive data from</b></h3>
